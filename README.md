## What is DDoS?
DDoS stands for “distributed denial of service“, DDoS is a type of cyberattack. The primary target using a DDoS attack is to take down the Network infrastructure or crash the server. The attack takes place by sending unwanted traffic to the Network which doesn’t allow the real traffic. The interesting fact in DDoS attacks is mostly probably cybercriminals use IoT (Internet of things) devices in distributed denial of service attacks.
